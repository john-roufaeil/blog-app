## Setting up and Running Locally

To set up the project follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies ```npm i```

2. Run Apollo Server ```nodemon graphQL/server.js```

3. Run Next.js ```npm run dev```

## Implementation

I used Next.js for server-side rendering, React.js for building UI components, Tailwind CSS for styling components, and GraphQL for fetching data.

I used a mock API called [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com). I used its posts, users, and comments data. This mock API has data organized such that there are 10 users, each having 10 posts, where each post has 5 comments.

I created the logo of the application using [Canva](https://canva.com).
